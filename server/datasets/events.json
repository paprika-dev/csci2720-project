The author makes a confession that shows his dissatisfaction about the reality and his own past, with an honest and passionate approach. \n\nThis was a story took place in Hong Kong and Shenzhen within one year. The father often went to the latter for illegal dealings, while the son, Chan Kin-hong, also went there to escape from his family and lover. Both his girlfriend and mother were in a state of depression, seeking spiritual outlets. Chan got some inspiration about life from a schoolteacher who sadly passed away. Although he found a cohabitant in Shenzhen, he was still trapped in his routine life. All these characters had missed or had not treasured their youths. Now they were longing for the return of the ‘glamorous youth’!",

Starting from this film, ‘urban village’ is no longer a concept, but a concrete image on the screen. .\n\nFounded by Ou Ning in 1999, U-theque was a civic film group active in Shenzhen and Guangzhou around the millennium. He and Cao Fei were invited by the Venice Biennale to make this film as a commissioned work. The directors, assisted by U-theque core members, conduct a cross-sectional study on Guangzhou with San Yuan Li, an urban village, as the starting point. As roamers in the city, the authors explore the debt of history, the conflicts and reconciliations of modernisation and the settlement-based culture in Lingnan, as well as the strange architecture and cultural landscape of urban villages. Eventually, it becomes a visual poem without narration.\n\n\nCop Shop ll\nDirector: Zhou Hao\nCinematographers: Yuan Zhe, Zhou Hao\nSound Recording: Zhou Hao\nEditor: Tan Jiaying\nProducer: Shen Hao\n2011 | Colour | 70’ | Digital File\nIn Putonghua with Chinese and English subtitles\n\nA concern for public places or organisatons is always an important motif in the works of Zhou Hao, a former journalist. Unlike the sober observation approach of the Direct Cinema, Zhou’s camera remains sober yet warm. He also interacts with shooting targets through it. \n\nIn 2010, Zhou finished the documentary Cop Shop, which won the runner-up prize in the Shorts Group of Chinese Documentary Festival in Hong Kong next year. He returned to the police station at Yuexiu District of the Guangzhou Railway Station to shoot Cop Shop ll during the Chinese New Year in 2011. It was one of the busiest stations in China, with 200,000 people arrived or left the Station each day and 300 cops were on duty at that period. Those who went into the police station were people with various types of difficulties. This could be a good starting point to observe Chinese society. \n\nExchange Session in Cantonese and Putonghua\nSpeakers: Zhou Hao, Herman Yau",

Fleeing to Hong Kong after having a lot of setbacks in life, Ip became a man of the world and was willing to solve problems for others. The film depicts in detail the difficult journey that leads him to finally be regarded as a true master. \n\nIp, middle-aged and suffered from stomach trouble, came from the Mainland to earn a living in Hong Kong by teaching Wing Tsun at the premises of a labour union. Among his students, there were active unionists, as well as policemen who suppressed labour strikes. Trying to resolve their conflicts, Ip asked them to act according to their conscience. But the students did not understand him when he got acquainted with a sex worker in his later years. Although he sometimes would make friends with his enemies, he was not afraid to have a duel with a thug for justice. Besides restoring Ip as a true human being with flesh and blood, the film also showcases the moral of Lingnan martial arts and the cityscape of Hong Kong from 1950s to 1960s.",

Created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ballet Flamenco Sara Baras, Sara took the occasion to pay tribute to the Spanish guitar virtuoso and composer Paco de Lucía (1947 - 2014), who left a revolutionary influence on flamenco music with his work.Vuela (means \"Fly\" in English), was conceived from the respect, passion and love both artists shared. The choreographic journey of Vuela is composed of 15 unique pieces in four acts, each centered around the themes of wood, sea, death, and fly, creating flamenco language in motion with a strong narrative.Celebrated for her lightning-fast footwork, intricate movements and captivating stage presence choreography, Sara Baras is the foremost exponent of flamenco dance and one of the most prestigious and recongised Spanish representatives in the performing arts international scene. She was hailed by the Bachtrack online music magazine as \"a superstar who transcends genres\". Baras established Ballet Flamenco Sara Baras in 1998, and has since choreographed 17 productions which toured in all five continents. Over the years, she has won multiple awards and has featured in an array of films.",
